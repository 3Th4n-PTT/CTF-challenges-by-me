It's about inject to `new RegExp(#...#)` and `req.body[k]`


Since `password` column is generated by random string, and will re-random each time server crash. You have to extract the keys of object `this`.
```
username=bbbb
&|(if.*(").*\sreturn.*\s.*\s.*)|=zzz$2;  this[Object.keys.call`${this}`[3]].charCodeAt`0` > 0x30 ? blah`` : 2 ; $2
```

Then blind the each character, if your condition is right, the server will crash, then you got http error response (because of calling `blah` function is not exists), the node server also crash cause throwing expection (the password column will also be re-random again).
